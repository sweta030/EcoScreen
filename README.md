# Idle Monitor Detection System

## Overview
- The Idle Monitor Detection System is a video analysis tool designed to identify and highlight monitors or screens in an office environment that are active but not being used by employees. By analyzing CCTV footage, the system aims to enhance monitoring and improve energy efficiency by providing visual indications of idle screens.

## Features
- Real-time Detection: Analyze live CCTV footage to detect active but unused monitors/screens.
- Visual Marking: Highlight idle monitors/screens in the video feed.
- Energy Efficiency: Provide insights to help manage and reduce energy consumption.
- Customizable Alerts: Set thresholds for inactivity and receive notifications.

## Technology Stack
- Languages/Frameworks: Python, Gradio.
- Libraries/Tools: YOLOv9 (Ultralytics), OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, PIL, Roboflow.
- Hardware: GPU for acceleration.
- Roboflow: Dataset annotation.

## Future Scope
1. Enhanced Detection Algorithms: Integrate advanced machine learning models and multi-monitor support for improved accuracy.
2. Integration with Energy Management Systems: Develop automated controls and energy consumption reporting for optimized power usage.
3. Real-time Analytics and Reporting: Create a web-based dashboard for real-time monitoring, detailed reporting, and customizable alerts.
4. Scalability and Cross-platform Support: Explore cloud solutions for scalable deployment and ensure compatibility with various systems.
5. Privacy, Security, and User Interaction: Implement robust privacy measures, secure access controls, and user-friendly interfaces.
